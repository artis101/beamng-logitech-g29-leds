Hi there! 👋 This is a utility designed and developed to connect your Logitech G29 steering wheel's LEDs with the BeamNG.drive game by reading the car's RPM data in real-time. Pretty cool, right? 🚀

## 🎯 What does it do?

### TL;DR here's a video of it in action

This utility makes your gaming experience more immersive by syncing your Logitech G29's LED indicators with your in-game vehicle's RPM data. As you rev up your car in the game, the LED indicators on your steering wheel will react accordingly.

Before BeamNG.drive is connected, the utility is in the test mode where the LEDs respond to the gas pedal.

Once the game is connected, it switches to the game mode where the LEDs respond to the car's RPM in the game.

You can enter the Max RPM of the car you're using at any time by typing the number of RPM in and pressing Enter. The default is 7000 RPM.

1. **Node.js:** The utility is built with Node.js, a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
2. **logitech-g29:** This Node.js module allows us to interface with the Logitech G29 steering wheel.
